SWMH 3.41 [2020-03-06]
	*CHANGES:*
		Decision changes:
			Three vanilla decisions have been incorporated: "Embrace Local Traditions" (changes Rurikid characters' culture to Russian), "Establish Cairo", and "Establish Castle Habsburg".
		Bloodline changes:
			Historical bloodlines of Alfred and Abu Sa'id Jannabid added.
			Historical bloodline of Vortigern and Bahram VI removed.
		Map changes:
			Added a passable border between the provinces of Zemplén and Galich, representing the Veretsky Pass.
			Renamed the province of Karasu to the more period-appropriate Balkhan.
			The empire title containing the kingdoms of Hungary, Wallachia, Moldova, Croatia, and Bosnia is now called "Carpathia" instead of "Magyarország", and is no longer flagged as a principally Hungarian title.
				This title contains a multitude of different cultures, all of which could potentially end up forming this empire title (and if a player is starting in 867, the Magyars may potentially not even move into the Carpathian Basin), so having its name be derived purely from Hungary's could break immersion. 
		Other changes:
			Added equivalencies to some Turkic names (e.g. Toghril, Timur)
			Removed names deriving from Baghatur, as the term only became a personal name in the post-Mongol era
			The Holy Roman Empire will now always start with *Princely Elective Succession* instead of only taking effect when Heinrich II is crowned in 1002.
			Added Arabic and Iranian dynamic cultural localization to the Kingdom of Georgia.
			The province and duchy of Cairo are now called Fustat before 969.

			Vukova is now ruled by Croatia instead of Hungary, and Srem/Syrmia is now ruled by Bulgaria instead of Hungary.

SWMH 3.4 [2019-12-20]
	*HIGHLIGHTS:*
		Introduced the Iron Century Bookmark (936).
		Introduced the 993-1018 timeline.
		Added 39 new provinces in South India.
		Added 11 new provinces.
	*CHANGES:*
		Map changes:
			Added 11 new provinces: Maysan in southern Iraq; Sus in southern Persia; Shapurkhwast in western Persia; Dzoraget and Kambechovani in the Caucasus; Selymbria in Thrace; Bampur in Makran; Dathina and Marib in Yemen; Ardabil in Azerbaijan; Qurta in northern Nubia.
			Replaced the province of Larestan with Istakhr in western Persia.
			Replaced the province of El-Rif (to the north of Fez) with the province of Tadla (south of Fez).
			2 provinces merged in Nubia (into Dongola and Soba).
			Added an extra sea zone in South India (Konkan Coast).
			Made some adjustments to the Trans-Saharan Trade Route.
			Adjusted the borders around Nishapur to better reflect historical roads.
			Slight Zoroastrian holy site changes.
		Province setup changes:
			Duchy of Luristan added in western Persia.
			The island of Socotra is now a de jure duchy belonging to the kingdom of Yemen.
			Ardabil is now de jure capital of the duchy of Azerbaijan until 1186.
			Shuffled around the barony setup in Susa and Sfax and changed the province border accordingly (no change in the total number of baronies).
			Reduced the number of barony slots in some Siberian provinces where baronies are named after settlements that were built after the CK2 timeframe.
			Revised the barony setup in Ethiopia, Persia, Maghreb, Hungary and western Anatolia.
			The province of Kharraqan moved under the duchy of Rayy for a more historically sound setup.
			Maximum barony counts for Balasaghun and Yulduz increased to 5.
		Mechanic changes:
			[EMF+SWMH] The HRE can now be created like a normal title if it isn't titular. Previously, it could only be peacefully usurped with EMF+SWMH (peaceful usurpation implying that it's not titular as well) -- not created.
			[EMF+SWMH] Ensured that the Byzantine Empire cannot be created if, for various possible reasons, Constantinople is no longer a de jure part of its territory.
			[EMF+SWMH] Improved title creation/usurpation tooltips for historically de jure empires which have extra requirements upon your realm size (number of holdings in realm) that can be bypassed if the title has or will have *High Crown Authority* or higher. This includes the *Holy* Roman Empire, the Roman Empire, the Persian Empire, and the Arabian Empire.
			Incorporated vanilla decisions to form the Kingdoms of Leon, Castile, Aragon, and Portugal.
			Eastern Iberia now falls under a placeholder de jure kingdom of Valencia until mid-13th century.
			There are no longer any foreigner opinion penalties between Parsig characters and Pársí ones, and there are no longer any foreigner opinion penalties between Sogdian characters and Tajik ones.
			The base population gained per empty holding for nomads is now 1550 (from 1400). This number leads to closer parity with the population gained from similarly-sized territories in the vanilla map than before (i.e. it compensates for there being fewer provinces in the Steppes regions better than before).
			Arctic terrain now has a baseline 30% Narrow Flank chance (from 15%) and a -33.33% movement speed modifier (from -16.67%). These stats were previously only present when LTM (a mod many assumed to only be a graphical one) was installed alongside SWMH, but they have now been incorporated into the SWMH mod proper.
			The Kingdom of Kiev is no longer renamed Kievan Rus upon startup.
		Culture setup changes:
			Standardized and corrected many Hungarian and Székely cultural names and adjectives. They now all use modern Hungarian spellings (e.g. Kozár -> Kazár, Sikhiya -> Szícsia), but old/medieval Hungarian names (e.g. Zágreb -> Gréc, Nyitra -> Felföld, Belgrád -> Nándorfehérvár).
			Added a new culture to the Magyar cultural group called Moger. Moger represents pagan Magyars with a semi-nomadic culture and lifestyle, while Magyar now represents Christian Magyars with a more settled lifestyle.
				Mogers use cultural names similar to Magyars', but spelled using Old Hungarian instead of modern Hungarian. This is to differentiate between the two cultures more easily.
				All Magyar characters and provinces who start as pagan will now start as Moger instead of Magyar.
				Steppe Barracks and Steppe Stables buildings are now only available to Mogers in the Magyar cultural group.
				Magyars can no longer raid by default, as this feature has now been moved to Mogers.
				Moger rulers will eventually become Magyars if they are Christian, are not nomadic, and have provinces in their demesne that are not Steppes. Their Moger courtiers will quickly follow suit if their capital is also not in a Steppe province.
			Added a new culture to the Altaic cultural group called Qavar (alternatively known as Kabar, Qabar, or Khavar). Qavar represents the Qasar/Khazar tribes who rebelled against the confederation, were exiled as punishment, and ended up joining forces with the Magyars.
				Qavars are almost identical to Qasars/Khazars, but their dynasty names tend to have less Jewish influence. This represents the suspect coincidence of the Qasars/Khazars' conversion to Judaism and the Qavar rebellion.
				Rulers and provinces under Moger/Magyar domain that used to be Qasar will now be Qavar instead.
				Christian Qavars under a Magyar top liege and Christian Qavar provinces under Magyar owners will eventually become Székely. Practically speaking, this is the only real mechanical difference betweens Qasars and Qavars, and is the reason for having Qavar as a separate culture in the first place.
			Replaced Roman-derived Berber names with more period-appropriate ones, based on historical figures'.
		Bloodline changes:
			Blood of Árpád is now active for all characters in the Magyar cultural group, not just Magyars, and provides an opinion bonus from all cultures in the Magyar cultural group, not just Magyars.
			Changed the effects of Eleanor of Aquitaine, Arwa, and Basil, and Alexander Nevsky bloodlines.
			The Solomonid bloodline now confers opinion bonus from Miaphysite characters only.
			The Muhammad Nasrid bloodline now confers opinion bonus from Andalusian Arabic characters only.
		Localization changes:
			Added native Berber tribal titles.
			Added native Hungarian feudal, city, and temple titles.
			African tribal titles no longer use the Ra'is title.
			Afghan count title changed to Shar (used by the historical rulers of Gharchistan and Bamiyan).
			Corrected native localization of Sanhaja, Soghdian, Tajik, and Mongol cultures.
			Kingdom of Malwa has been renamed Malava (Sanskrit).
			The province of Vyazma has been renamed Rzhev.
			Replaced the remaining instances of the Arabic dj with j in province and title names.
		Other setup changes:
			Added 4 new bookmarks since 993: "The Age of Kings" (993), "Battle of Spercheios" (997), A New Millenium (1000), and "The Taifa Kings" (1032).
			Berber mercenary companies now employ Light Cavalry in addition to Camel Cavalry.
			Mamluk mercenary company now employs Light Cavalry, Horse Archers, and Heavy Cavalry instead of Camel Cavalry.
			Persian Caravan Guards mercenary company now employs Horse Archers instead of Camel Cavalry.

			Kingdom of Kiev is no longer ownerless in 1018.
			Duchy of Arran/Albania is no longer ownerless between 1031 and 1034.

			Bukhara is now de jure capital of the duchy of Soghd and kingdom of Mavar-an-Nahr until 1040.

			The province of Naissus/Niš will now start as Bálgarski/Bulgarian in 867 instead of Rumân/Romanian.

			The kingdom of Andalusia has many council empowerment laws enacted after 976 to reflect the historical rise of Almanzor as the real power behind the throne.			
			The barony of Satrata in Wargla is now constructed in its historical founding date of 908.
		11th century:

SWMH 3.29 [2019-09-06]
	*CHANGES:*
		The Kingdom of Navarra, the Duchy of Navarra, and the Counties of Alava, Guizpuzcoa, Labourd, Navarra, and Viscaya all adopt *Primogeniture* when they are historically taken over by Basque characters. The county of Labourd reverts back to *Gavelkind* succession in 985 due to being inherited by an Occitan character.
		The Kingdom of Poland will have *Elective Monarchy* succession starting from 1291.
		The Kingdom of Novgorod will now start with *Elective Monarchy* succession from its founding in 1136.

	*FIXES:*
		Removed duplicate Mausoleum of Halicarnassus from Lykia.
		Removed all of the on-map unit & councillor model reductions in scale from the previous release. Users without all of those DLCs were experiencing crashes, and when it comes to such on-map models, they really must be all of the same relative scale.
			We hope to have the HIP Installer only include scaled-down files referencing DLC assets for players' owned DLCs in the future, but in any case, we had to revert our previous changes to on-map unit & councillor scale for now.


SWMH 3.24 [2019-04-22]

		Compatibility patch for CKII v3.1 (Great Works).
		All provinces now have hand-positioned Great Works wonder and wonder-in-water on-map locations.
		A finer-grained map than vanilla calls for finer-grained on-map visual elements:
			City sprawl has been reduced to 30% of the vanilla setting to accomodate for SWMH's much smaller provinces. Users of SWMH with EMF or ARKOpack Armoiries were already inheriting smaller citysprawl values than vanilla, so the relative difference is not as great as -70% in practice (much less dramatic).
			All unit and councillor models have changed in scale by -35%.
			Inland trade post models have been reduced in scale by a third (-33.3% change).
			Coastal trade post models have changed in scale by -25%.
		The vanilla-only Featured Ruler system, which cannot work for any map/history overhaul mod, has been disabled for SWMH.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed the broken Gautske and Ulfing family / dynasty trees.


SWMH 3.22 [2019-03-29]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Finnish pagan characters can now intermarry with characters following norse, baltic, and slavic pagan faiths (SWMH without EMF).
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed the HRE turning Republic after 1166.
		Fixed the broken Miercisc, Gautske, Beornicisc, and Eardwulfing family trees.
		Unreformed Hellenics now have the proper graphical culture specified for their religion (SWMH without EMF).
		Bon pagans' home province modifier is now in line with the rest of the defensive pagan religions (SWMH without EMF).
		The titular HRE stem duchy titles (d_swabia, d_saxony, d_saxewittenberg, d_lower_lorraine, d_franconia, and d_bavaria) no longer inappropriately start the game with Primogeniture succession at all start dates.
		ERE now starts out with the same laws as in vanilla.
	*HISTORY SETUP:*
		Zvonimir bloodline repurposed into Tomislav bloodline.
		Banu Kanz and Hadariba realms are now unified between 943-1174.
		Seljuks no longer start out at war with the Byzantines without a break between 1066 and 1072.
