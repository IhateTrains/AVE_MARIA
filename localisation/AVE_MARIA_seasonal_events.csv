EVTDESC_AVE_MARIA_seasonal_flavour.1;The days are becoming shorter and much of the Autumn harvests are done being brought into the storehouses and preserved for the Winter. While walking through the market with your entourage one day you cannot help but acknowledge that the season of Brumalia is in full swing, with its evening banquets, exchanging of gifts, and sending cakes to friends or priests. As you walk past a stall with the delectable scent of fresh cakes, you wonder who you should send one to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_A_AVE_MARIA_seasonal_flavour.1;I should remember my beloved family first;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_B_AVE_MARIA_seasonal_flavour.1;Maybe one of my advisors would appreciate the gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AVE_MARIA_seasonal_flavour.2;You begin to walk across the street towards the church to attend this evening's service of Vespers. The air is cool and smells of Autumn. You find it to be distinctly solemn and peaceful. That is, until a door is opened across the street and you hear the merriment of a party! Could it be, that good Christians are still holding Brumalia banquets instead of going to Vespers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_A_AVE_MARIA_seasonal_flavour.2;Its about time someone put an end to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_B_AVE_MARIA_seasonal_flavour.2;Well, I suppose they're not hurting anyone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
